# Mean-Field-Theory-in-BCS
This repository is prepared for the work which I have done relating to the mean field theory in BCS.
The main part of the repository will be made up of Mathematica Notebooks, I guess.

Personally, I got contacted with this area in January, 2018, and thanks to the crucial and abundant help from Prof. Hu.
